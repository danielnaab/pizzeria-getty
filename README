"Getty Images Pizzeria", a code test.
-------------------------------------

This project is developed off of Python 2.7.1 and Django 1.3.1.  All
dependencies are in requirements.txt and pip installable.  The default project
settings use the sqlite3 database.

It is recommended to install all dependencies into a virtual environment.
Inside the virtual environment, install the dependencies:

    cd pizzeria
    pip install -r requirements.txt

To create a database and initialize it with data:

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py init-test-data

The `syncdb` invocation will request the creation of an administrative user.
For the sake of this project, admin users are considered "employees", and
non-admin users are "customers."  Therefore, create an admin user with your
preferred username/password during this step.

`init-test-data` will populate the database with some configurable data,
specifically pizza sizes and toppings.

To run a local, development server on http://localhost:8000:

    ./manage.py runserver

A few notes:
- The application uses lazy registration for order entry, so you can create an
order before creating an account.
- To modify the sale items, prices, etc, use the Django-admin interface,
accessible at:
    http://localhost:8000/admin/
- When logged in an an administrator, the "employee tools" nav menu (top) is
activated.
